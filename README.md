phpurl
======

PHPUrl library - copy of curl library for php, but fully written in PHP. 
So It can be used instead of curl on hostings which don't provide curl support ( like Google AppEngine ).

Just look in file helloworld.php for example of using. It has the same syntax as curl, you just need to add "include" to 
your current project and continue using it for instance on Google AppEngine for PHP.
